### Check if an Instagram profile is public or private using the username
[Demo](sotirelischristos.com/insta/)


**USAGE:**

Use *isPrivate($username, $client_id)* passing the target username and your **CLIENT ID** (provided when registering an app as developer on Instagram).

**Returns:**
* true 	  - if the user is private
* false 	- if the user is public
* unknown - if the state cannot be retreived
* -1 	    - if the user is not found

The script does **NOT** require an **ACCESS TOKEN** (granting target user's permission)!
